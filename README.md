## NTRU-HRSS

This code package contains the source code of the NTRU-HRSS-KEM scheme that was submitted to [NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography project](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Round-1-Submissions) in November 2017, with some additional minor bugfixes. This repository contains a C reference implementation and an optimized AVX2 implementation, in the respective directories.

The code presented here differs slightly from the [source code](https://github.com/joostrijneveld/NTRU-KEM) that accompanied the preceeding paper [_"High-speed key encapsulation from NTRU"_](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/667) published at [CHES 2017](https://ches.iacr.org/2017).

During the NIST standardization process, the NTRU-HRSS-KEM submission merged with NTRUEncrypt into NTRU. Please see the joint submission for up-to-date code [here](https://github.com/jschanck/ntru), and visit [ntru.org](https://ntru.org) for more information.
